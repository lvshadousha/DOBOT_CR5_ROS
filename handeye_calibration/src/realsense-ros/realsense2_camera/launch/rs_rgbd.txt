A launch file, derived from rgbd_launch and customized for Realsense ROS driver,
to publish XYZRGB point cloud like an OpenNI camera.

NOTICE: To use this launch file you must first install ros package rgbd_launch.

To launch Realsense with software registeration (ROS Image Pipeline and rgbd_launch):
    $ roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_rgbd.launch
Processing enabled by ROS driver:
    # depth rectification
Processing enabled by this node:
    # rgb rectification
    # depth registeration
    # pointcloud_xyzrgb generation

To launch Realsense with hardware registeration (ROS Realsense depth alignment):
    $ roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_rgbd.launch align_depth:=true
Processing enabled by ROS driver:
    # depth rectification
    # depth registration
Processing enabled by this node:
    # rgb rectification
    # pointcloud_xyzrgb generation
